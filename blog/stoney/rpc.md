### Google Protocol Buffers 
- Developers Guide
- Language Guide (proto3)
- Third-Party Add-ons for Protocol Buffers

### Google gRPC: [twitter]
- A high performance, open source, general RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first
- Powerful IDL : message, service
- Libraries in ten languages : C, C++, Java, Go, Node.js, Python, Ruby,Objective-C, PHP and C#
- HTTP/2

### Apache Thrift, [apache/thrift]
- a RPC framework designed to be efficient, and available across both OS platforms and programming languages
flexibility regarding transports (such as sockets, pipes, etc) and protocols (binary, JSON, even compressed), plus some more options like SSL or SASL support
- Actionscript 3.0, C++, CSharp, D, Delphi, Go, Graphviz, Haxe Framework, Haskell, Java, Javascript, Node.js, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby

- Thrift: The Missing Guide

### Apache Avro
- Rich data structures.
- A compact, fast, binary data format.
- A container file, to store persistent data.
- Remote procedure call (RPC).
- Simple integration with dynamic languages. Code generation is not required to read or write data files nor to use or implement RPC protocols. Code generation as an optional optimization, only worth implementing for statically typed languages.
- schemas are defined with JSON
